   "content": "Arya Stark is the third child and second daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully. A member of House Stark, she has five siblings: brothers Robb, Bran, Rickon, half-brother Jon Snow, and older sister Sansa. She is a POV character in A Song of Ice and Fire and is portrayed by Maisie Williams in the television adaptation, Game of Thrones.\nLike some of her siblings, Arya sometimes dreams that she is a direwolf. Her own direwolf is Nymeria, who is named in reference to the Rhoynar warrior-queen of the same name.\n\n\n== Appearance and Character ==\n\nSee also: Images of Arya StarkNine years old at the start of A Game of Thrones, Arya's appearance is more Stark than Tully, with a long face, grey eyes, and brown hair. She is skinny and athletic. She is generally regarded as plain, as exemplified by her nickname \"Arya Horseface\", and is often mistaken for a boy. However, there are instances of her being called pretty and compared to her beautiful late aunt, Lyanna Stark.Arya is a spirited girl interested in fighting and exploration, unlike her older sister, Sansa. Arya wants to learn how to fight with a sword and ride in tourneys, to the horror of Sansa, who enjoys the more traditional pursuits of a noblewoman. Arya is particularly close to her half brother, Jon Snow, who encourages her martial pursuits. She is said to take after the fiery Lyanna in temperament. Arya often bites her lip.Arya is left-handed, quick, and dexterous. She received a noble's education from Maester Luwin at Winterfell and is said to be good with mathematics and an excellent horse rider. She knows at least a bit of High Valyrian.\n\n\n== History ==\nBorn in 289 AC at Winterfell, Arya is the youngest daughter and third child of Lord Eddard Stark, the head of House Stark and Warden of the North, and Lady Catelyn Tully. Arya has an older sister, Sansa, an older brother, Robb, and two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon. She also has an older bastard half-brother, Jon Snow.Arya has spend her entire life at Winterfell, though she did accompany her father on two occasions to White Harbor. Arya has been tutored by Septa Mordane in the womanly arts (including needlework), and received lessons from Maester Luwin as well. Arya was also taught to ride a horse, but due to being called \"Arya Horseface\" by Jeyne Poole because of her long face, she could not enjoy the fact that riding horses was one of the few things she was better at than her older sister. The House Stark guards call her \"Arya Underfoot\".Jon Snow, having covered himself with flour to appear as a ghost, once tried to scare his younger siblings in the crypt of Winterfell. While Sansa and Bran were frightened, Arya instead punched her half brother.Lord Eddard often eats in the same hall as his staff, and always keeps a seat next to him reserved, inviting a different servant or advisor to dine with him each night. Arya loves listening to their stories.\n\n\n== Recent Events ==\n\n\n=== A Game of Thrones ===\n\nWhen her brothers Robb and Jon find six direwolf pups, Arya adopts one of them, whom she names Nymeria, in reference to the Rhoynish warrior-queen of the same name.Arya and her sister, Sansa, travel with their father, Lord Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, Arya's half-brother Jon gives her a sword called Needle, after her least favorite ladylike activity, as a parting gift. He tells her she will need to practice, but that the first lesson is to \"stick 'em with the pointy end\". On the way south, she befriends a peasant boy named Mycah, and they often play at swords.While walking near the ruby ford, Prince Joffrey Baratheon and Sansa happen upon Arya and Mycah \"battling\" in the woods. Arya defends Mycah from Joffrey's torments, and Nymeria helps Arya fight off Joffrey, wounding his arm in the process. Knowing that Joffrey will likely want retribution, Jory Cassel helps Arya chase the direwolf away when he finds them. Arya is brought to Darry before King Robert I Baratheon, who counsels Eddard to discipline Arya. Queen Cersei Lannister is not satisfied with this, however, and orders Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed in Nymeria's place. Mycah, having fled, is tracked and killed by Joffrey's \"dog,\" Sandor Clegane. From this moment, Arya harbors a lasting enmity for the Hound.\nWhile in King's Landing, after Arya fights with Sansa, their father discovers Needle. Questioned how Arya gained possession of the sword, she refuses to give up Jon's name as the gift giver. Eddard realizes that she must be trained if she is entertaining ideas about swordsmanship, and hires Syrio Forel, a celebrated Braavosi swordsman, under whom Arya begins her training. Under his strict, but creative, tutelage, Arya learns to fight in the Braavosi water dancer style with Needle.Arya spends most of her time doing balancing and swordplay exercises as Syrio instructed her. During one of these she discovers a secret passage in the Red Keep. She overhears two men, who by description seem to be Varys and Illyrio Mopatis speaking about her father, Cersei, and spies.When tensions heighten in the capital, Ned intends for Sansa and Arya to return to the north via the Wind Witch. His plans are halted by the Robert's death, however, and the succession of King Joffrey I. During the purge of House Stark from the Red Keep, Ser Meryn Trant and House Lannister guards attempt to take Arya into custody, but Syrio holds off Arya's attackers with a practice sword so she can flee. Arya kills a stableboy with Needle and escapes the castle using the passage she found earlier, but Sansa is captured by the Lannisters and Septa Mordane is slain.Arya cannot leave King's Landing since the city gates are heavily guarded, so she lives on the streets of Flea Bottom, catching pigeons and rats to trade for food. Arya witnesses her father's public condemnation at the Great Sept of Baelor. She is found in the crowd by Yoren of the Night's Watch, who saves her from the sight of Eddard's execution and drags her from King's Landing.Cersei has Sansa send letters to Winterfell, but Arya's mother, Catelyn Stark, notices that no mention is made of Arya. Catelyn negotiates an alliance between Robb, her eldest son, and Lord Walder Frey at the Twins, and the agreement calls for Arya to wed one of Walder's sons, Elmar Frey.\n\n\n=== A Clash of Kings ===\nArya escapes King's Landing with Yoren and his party of Night's Watch recruits, with Yoren planning to return her to Winterfell on his way back the Wall. Yoren shaves her head and makes Arya assume the identity of \"Arry\", a boy recruit traveling with Yoren to the Wall. They make it as far as a deserted town near the Gods Eye lake, where they are attacked by House Lannister raiders led by Ser Amory Lorch. Yoren is killed and Arya is one of the few to escape alive, along with Gendry, Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, and Weasel. Before escaping the burning town, she saves the lives of three chained Night's Watch prisoners: Jaqen H'ghar, Rorge, and Biter.Arya heads out with the survivors until they are captured by Ser Gregor Clegane and the Mountain's men in a village, where they are held for eight days, while the Tickler tortures the villagers. Rafford kills Lommy and Polliver takes Needle from Arya. During the journey to Harrenhal, Arya creates a prayer of those she hates and wants to kill. These include Gregor Clegane, Dunsen, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling, the Tickler, Sandor Clegane, Amory Lorch, Ilyn Payne, Meryn Trant, Joffrey Baratheon, and Cersei Lannister.\n\nAt Harrenhal Arya is assigned to the steward Weese to work at the Wailing Tower. Several days later, Arya reunites with Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter, who are now in the employ of Amory. Jaqen comes to her at night and offers her three deaths for the three lives—Rorge, Biter, and himself—she saved from burning at the Gods Eye. After several days Arya names Chiswyck, after she overhears him boast at how he participated in a gang rape, and he dies three days later. Next she names Weese, for striking her. Weese's death is untraceable, apparently linked to his small dog that he raised from a pup. While trying to figure out the last name to say, Arya realizes she should have said a more important name, such as Lord Tywin Lannister or Amory Lorch. Finally, she names Jaqen himself. To make her unsay his name, Jaqen agrees to help her free Robett Glover's and Ser Aenys Frey's men in the dungeon and stage an uprising.Unbeknownst to Arya, Robett is already conspiring with Vargo Hoat against Amory. During the fall of Harrenhal, Arya obtains soup which Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter then use to scald the Lannister guards. To Arya's amazement, Jaqen changes his face and manner in front of her, saying it was time for that person to die. Before departing, he gives Arya an iron coin and tells her to repeat the phrase valar morghulis to any man of Braavos.The next morning, Lord Roose Bolton arrives to take charge of the castle. Arya, now calling herself \"Nymeria\", or \"Nan\" for short, is named Roose's cupbearer for her role in the freeing of the prisoners. She inadvertently meets Elmar Frey, the squire she would have to marry under Robb's agreement with the Freys, though they remain unknown to each other. Lord Bolton has Arya help him with leechings and orders her to burn his wife Walda's letter.Arya asks to accompany Roose when he leaves Harrenhal, but Lord Bolton is shocked by his servant's insolence and announces she will be left behind at the castle with Vargo's Brave Companions. Arya escapes with Gendry and Hot Pie, killing a Bolton guard at the gate.\n\n\n=== A Storm of Swords ===\nWhile Arya and her companions travel north from Harrenhal, Arya enters Nymeria during a dream as a skinchanger and sees Nymeria kill members of the Brave Companions sent in pursuit. Not long afterwards, she and her companions are discovered by a group of the brotherhood without banners and taken to the Inn of the Kneeling Man, where she is recognized by one of her father's former guards, Harwin. While Hot Pie remains at the inn, Arya and Gendry journey with the brotherhood and visit Lord Lymond Lychester, the Lady of the Leaves, the ghost of High Heart, and Lady Ravella Smallwood at Acorn Hall. Arya stays at the Peach in Stoney Sept, where the outlaws take custody of Sandor Clegane.At Harrenhal, Lord Roose Bolton informs Ser Jaime Lannister that Arya has been found and that he intends to return her to the north.Arya travels with the brotherhood to their hideout in a hollow hill. She accuses Sandor of murdering Mycah, earning him a trial by combat with Lord Beric Dondarrion. The Hound survives, however, and so is set free by the outlaws. Arya witnesses the battle at the burning septry between the brotherhood and Brave Companions. Although Thoros has been able to revive Beric several times, Arya learns that it would not be possible to revive her beheaded father, Eddard Stark. Beric knights Gendry, who decides to remain with the outlaw brotherhood. The ghost of High Heart is disturbed by Arya when the outlaws return to her hill. Disappointed that the brotherhood intends to ransom her to her brother Robb, now the King in the North, and feeling alone, Arya attempts to flee but ends up captured by Sandor Clegane, who was trailing the group.Sandor plans to return Arya to Robb and win a place in his service, but they are delayed by flooding along the Trident, including at Lord Harroway's Town. They reach the Twins, where Robb has gathered hosts for the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully to Roslin Frey. Arya does not recognize men outside the castles, however. When the slaughter of the Red Wedding begins, the Hound prevents Arya from running into the castle by knocking her out with the flat of his axe. Robb and Catelyn are slain inside the Twins, betrayed by Houses Bolton and Frey.\n\nSandor decides that the only place left to take Arya is to the Vale of Arryn, which is ruled by Arya's aunt, the widowed Lysa Arryn. On the way east, Arya finds a saddled horse which she takes as her mount and names Craven. Sandor gives the gift of mercy to a Piper bowman, and Arya dreams of Nymeria dragging a body from a river. They briefly stay at a village in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon, but learn they cannot take the high road to Lysa at the Eyrie. Sandor decides to head back towards Riverrun to instead ransom Arya to her great uncle, Ser Brynden Tully.On their way Arya and Sandor stop at the crossroads inn. They meet the Tickler and Polliver, two of the men in Arya's prayer, as well as a young squire. Arya is confused when Polliver mentions that Lord Bolton's bastard, Ramsay Snow, is to marry Sansa's sister. The Hound gets drunk and a fight ensues. Arya takes a dagger from the squire and stabs him in the belly while the Hound kills Polliver, though he is badly wounded in the fight. As the Tickler closes in on Sandor, Arya sneaks behind and repeatedly stabs the torturer with his own dagger while echoing the questions he asked of his victims on their journey to Harrenhal. Sandor directs her to finish off the squire, who is dying of his wound. Arya reclaims Needle from Polliver's corpse and stabs the squire in the heart.Arya and Sandor head towards the town of Saltpans, but Sandor is too weak to continue and falls from his horse. Arya draws Needle, intending to kill him, but decides to leave him to die instead of administering the mercy of a quick death. She sells Craven at Saltpans and gains passage on the Titan's Daughter, a ship headed to Braavos, by using the coin that Jaqen H'ghar had given her, along with the High Valyrian phrase valar morghulis.Jaime Lannister sees Steelshanks Walton, Roose Bolton's captain, depart King's Landing with a northern girl who claims to be Arya. Jaime thinks the real Arya is dead.\n\n\n=== A Feast for Crows ===\n\nDuring the voyage to Braavos on the Titan's Daughter Arya uses the name \"Salty\". Captain Ternesio Terys and many of the sailors ask Arya to learn and remember their names, and many seem afraid of her. The captain has his older son Yorko row Arya to shore so as to get her off the ship prior to customs coming aboard.In Braavos, Arya finds her way to the House of Black and White, where a kindly old man initiates her into the guild of the Faceless Men. She is required to discard her old personality, including her belongings, to begin the training. She does this, except for Needle, which she hides in a safe location.  She speaks the Braavosi tongue with a strong accent.Arya's training requires her to go out into the city under the identity of \"Cat of the Canals\", a street urchin, to learn secrets and report them to the kindly man. She also begins learning the art of lying from the waif. During this time, she kills a deserter from the Night's Watch named Dareon, and she briefly meets Samwell Tarly, a friend of her half brother Jon Snow, though they do not introduce themselves to each other. After these incidents, she accepts milk meant for \"Arya\". When she wakes the next morning, she is blind.Brienne of Tarth visits the Quiet Isle during her search for Sansa Stark. She learns from the Elder Brother that Sansa's sister Arya had been in the company of Sandor Clegane, but she may have been killed in the raid on Saltpans.\n\n\n=== A Dance with Dragons ===\n\nArya remains blind and in the service of the House of Black and White in Braavos. The blindness is induced by the milk she drinks every night. She continues to dream through the eyes of her direwolf, Nymeria, but speaks of it to no one. She still struggles with leaving her identity as Arya Stark behind. While she is blind, Arya wears the guise of \"Beth\", a beggar girl. She wanders the streets of Braavos, begging for money and listening for bits and pieces of information. She becomes better at lying and detecting the lies of others.Arya receives her sight again after she is able to identify the kindly man and hit him with a stick when he sneaks up on her.  It is implied, however, that she does not simply sense his presence (as he assumes) but sees him through the eyes of a cat hiding in the rafters.After regaining her sight, Arya is given her first assassination assignment. She is asked to give \"the gift\" to an old man who sells a type of insurance for ships. The kindly man takes her to the secret lower chambers of the House of Black and White, where thousands of faces are hung on the walls. Arya is given the face of an ugly, broken girl who had been beaten by her father and came to the House of Black and White to seek the gift. Arya watches her target carefully for days. She notices that the old man has guards with him wherever he goes, and always tests the coin he is given with his teeth. While watching him, she attempts to find ways to justify his fate, but the kindly man tells her it is not for her to judge the old man.In the end, Arya feigns stealing a bag of coins from a captain on his way to meet with the old man. She splits the bag in the attempt, and switches one of the captain's coins with one of her own, coated in poison. After the switch, she escapes. Later, the old man's heart mysteriously gives out. The kindly man then gives Arya an acolyte's robe and assigns her to begin her first apprenticeship with Izembaro.Following the siege of Moat Cailin, Theon Greyjoy learns that House Bolton are claiming Jeyne Poole to be Arya. Jon Snow, now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, is shocked when Castle Black is informed that Ramsay Bolton is to marry his sister. Melisandre tells Jon she saw a vision in her flames of a girl, Arya, fleeing a wedding, but it is Alys Karstark who arrives at Castle Black seeking protection from Jon against Cregan Karstark. Ramsay marries Jeyne at Winterfell, and the northern mountain clans agree to support Stannis Baratheon so they can rescue the Ned's girl. As Stannis's host approaches Winterfell, Theon helps Jeyne escape the castle and they are brought to Stannis in a crofters' village.\n\n\n=== The Winds of Winter ===\nTheon convinces Jeyne that for her own safety she should continue impersonating Arya. Stannis orders Ser Justin Massey to bring the girl to Castle Black.Under the identity of \"Mercedene\" or \"Mercy\", Arya is now a mummer at a playhouse called the Gate, owned by Izembaro. She is still experiencing wolf dreams, the latest with a tree watching her.When Ser Harys Swyft arrives in Braavos on a mission to negotiate with the Iron Bank of Braavos on behalf of King Tommen I Baratheon, the mummers of the Gate perform the play The Bloody Hand in which Arya plays a maid, presumably Shae, who is raped by Tyrion Lannister, played by a dwarf named Bobono.However, as the play is about to begin, Arya notices that one of Harys's guards is Rafford, one of the Mountain's men. She seduces him and takes him to her room. She tires him out by running there, and thus she is able to stab him in his thigh, cutting his femoral artery and rendering him unable to walk. Raff the Sweetling pleads to have him carried to a healer, but Arya replies: \"Think so?\" and stabs him in the throat, just as he did to the disabled Lommy. Arya throws his corpse in a canal and heads back to the Gate before she is due to come on stage.\n\n\n== Arya and death ==\n\n\n=== Arya's prayer ===\n\nDuring her journey, Arya is subjected to many hard situations in the war-torn riverlands. Her fiery personality prompts her to take the initiative and fight back, and so she is led to kill and ultimately wishes to murder specific characters herself. This course of action is supposed to end as of A Feast for Crows with her being an assassin trainee in Braavos, as the leader stresses becoming indifferent to death and killing. She continues, however, to repeat to herself the names of the people she wishes dead. Some names are added as she goes, and others are dropped when the character dies or becomes closer to her. She calls it a prayer, and ends it with the words valar morghulis. The names are:\n\nArya wants to add House Frey to the prayer after the Red Wedding, but she does not know the names of those responsible.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nArya also kills a number of people who were not in her prayer:\n\na Red Keep stableboy, during the purge of the Stark household\nat least one soldier of Amory Lorch, during the attack on Yoren's recruits at the Gods Eye town\na Bolton guard at Harrenhal, to escape the castle\na Sarsfield squire, during the fight at the crossroads inn\nDareon, at Braavos after noticing he was a deserter from the Night's Watch\na Braavosi insurance salesman, under orders of the kindly manArya initiates and, along with Jaqen H'ghar, Rorge, and Biter, takes part in the killing of eight of Amory's men during the fall of Harrenhal, an event that would be remembered for its \"weasel soup,\" from the nickname she used at the time.\n\n\n== Quotes by Arya ==\n - thoughts of Arya\n\n - Arya after the killing of Chiswyck\n\n - thoughts of Arya\n\n - thoughts of Arya\n\n - Arya to herself\n\n - plague face and Arya\n\n\n== Quotes about Arya ==\n – Eddard Stark to Arya\n\n – Jaqen H'ghar to Arya\n\n – thoughts of Catelyn Stark\n\n – thoughts of Catelyn Stark\n\n – thoughts of Theon Greyjoy\n\n– Theon Greyjoy recognizing Jeyne Poole\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n== References and Notes ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nArya Stark on the Game of Thrones wiki.This page uses content from the English Wikipedia.

   "section_a_game_of_thrones": "When her brothers Robb and Jon find six direwolf pups, Arya adopts one of them, whom she names Nymeria, in reference to the Rhoynish warrior-queen of the same name.Arya and her sister, Sansa, travel with their father, Lord Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, Arya's half-brother Jon gives her a sword called Needle, after her least favorite ladylike activity, as a parting gift. He tells her she will need to practice, but that the first lesson is to \"stick 'em with the pointy end\". On the way south, she befriends a peasant boy named Mycah, and they often play at swords.While walking near the ruby ford, Prince Joffrey Baratheon and Sansa happen upon Arya and Mycah \"battling\" in the woods. Arya defends Mycah from Joffrey's torments, and Nymeria helps Arya fight off Joffrey, wounding his arm in the process. Knowing that Joffrey will likely want retribution, Jory Cassel helps Arya chase the direwolf away when he finds them. Arya is brought to Darry before King Robert I Baratheon, who counsels Eddard to discipline Arya. Queen Cersei Lannister is not satisfied with this, however, and orders Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed in Nymeria's place. Mycah, having fled, is tracked and killed by Joffrey's \"dog,\" Sandor Clegane. From this moment, Arya harbors a lasting enmity for the Hound.\nWhile in King's Landing, after Arya fights with Sansa, their father discovers Needle. Questioned how Arya gained possession of the sword, she refuses to give up Jon's name as the gift giver. Eddard realizes that she must be trained if she is entertaining ideas about swordsmanship, and hires Syrio Forel, a celebrated Braavosi swordsman, under whom Arya begins her training. Under his strict, but creative, tutelage, Arya learns to fight in the Braavosi water dancer style with Needle.Arya spends most of her time doing balancing and swordplay exercises as Syrio instructed her. During one of these she discovers a secret passage in the Red Keep. She overhears two men, who by description seem to be Varys and Illyrio Mopatis speaking about her father, Cersei, and spies.When tensions heighten in the capital, Ned intends for Sansa and Arya to return to the north via the Wind Witch. His plans are halted by the Robert's death, however, and the succession of King Joffrey I. During the purge of House Stark from the Red Keep, Ser Meryn Trant and House Lannister guards attempt to take Arya into custody, but Syrio holds off Arya's attackers with a practice sword so she can flee. Arya kills a stableboy with Needle and escapes the castle using the passage she found earlier, but Sansa is captured by the Lannisters and Septa Mordane is slain.Arya cannot leave King's Landing since the city gates are heavily guarded, so she lives on the streets of Flea Bottom, catching pigeons and rats to trade for food. Arya witnesses her father's public condemnation at the Great Sept of Baelor. She is found in the crowd by Yoren of the Night's Watch, who saves her from the sight of Eddard's execution and drags her from King's Landing.Cersei has Sansa send letters to Winterfell, but Arya's mother, Catelyn Stark, notices that no mention is made of Arya. Catelyn negotiates an alliance between Robb, her eldest son, and Lord Walder Frey at the Twins, and the agreement calls for Arya to wed one of Walder's sons, Elmar Frey.",

  "jon-snow": {
   "content": "Jon Snow is the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell. He has five half-siblings: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark. Unaware of the identity of his mother, Jon was raised at Winterfell. At the age of fourteen, he joins the Night's Watch, where he earns the nickname Lord Snow. Jon is one of the major POV characters in A Song of Ice and Fire. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Jon is portrayed by Kit Harington.\n\n\n== Appearance and Character ==\nSee also: Images of Jon SnowJon has more Stark-like features than any of his half-brothers. He is graceful and quick, and has a lean build. Jon has the long face of the Starks, with dark, brown hair and grey eyes so dark they almost seem black. Because he looks so much like a Stark, Tyrion Lannister notes that whoever Jon's mother was, she left little of herself in her son's appearance. Out of all the Stark children, Arya Stark is said to resemble Jon the most, as Robb, Sansa, Bran and Rickon take after their Tully mother, Catelyn. During the Great Ranging, Jon temporarily grows a beard.Jon looks solemn and guarded, and is considered sullen and quick to sense a slight. Due to having been raised in a castle and trained by a master-at-arms, Jon is seen by some lower-born members of the Night's Watch as arrogant at first, though this changes when they become more friendly towards one another. Jon is observant, a trait he developed on account of being a bastard. He is a capable horseback rider and is well practiced in fighting with a sword. Jon has resented his bastard status most of the time. He desires to be viewed as honorable and wants to prove he can be as good and true as his half-brother, Robb. Jon dreamed he would one day lead men to glory, or even become a conqueror, as a child. He feels strongly about not fathering a bastard himself.While Lord Eddard Stark openly acknowledged Jon as his son and allowed him to live at Winterfell with his half-siblings, Jon felt like an outsider nonetheless. While Jon has good relationships with his siblings, especially Robb, with whom he trained since they were children, and Arya, whom he sees as somewhat of an outsider as well, Eddard's wife Catelyn, who was especially annoyed when Jon bested Robb in training or classes, ensured that Jon was never truly one of them. Jon is not close to Theon Greyjoy, Eddard's ward. Lord Eddard refuses to speak of Jon's mother and the boy grew up unaware of his mother's identity, something which has wounded and haunted him. When Jon dreams of her, he considers her to be beautiful, highborn, and kind.As a northerner raised at Winterfell, Jon keeps faith with the old gods. He eventually discovers that he is a warg, being able to see through the eyes of his direwolf, Ghost, when he sleeps, and experiencing Ghost's feelings and senses while awake.After joining the Night's Watch, Jon dresses in their official black garb. While there is no description of Jon's personal coat of arms in the books, George R. R. Martin told the company Valyrian Steel, which makes replicas of Jon's sword, to use the reversed Stark colors on the plaque that goes with the sword.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJon was born in 283 AC, near the end of Robert's Rebellion. Jon was named by Lord Eddard Stark.The identity of Jon Snow's mother remains a mystery, and several suggestions have been made by those who know the Starks. Jon is unaware of his mother's identity and Eddard refuses to speak of her. When Eddard returned from the war, he brought the newborn Jon to Winterfell, insisting on raising him with the rest of his family. Jon and his wet nurse had been installed in the castle before the arrival of Eddard's new wife, Catelyn Tully, and his young son and heir, Robb Stark, from Riverrun, which Catelyn did not take well.Lord Eddard Stark was fiercely protective of Jon and refused to send him away. Jon was raised at Winterfell with his half-siblings, where he was tutored by Maester Luwin, and trained at arms by the master-at-arms, Ser Rodrik Cassel. Jon has trained at swordplay since he was old enough to walk, together with Robb, whom he came to view as his \"best friend, rival and constant companion\", and later also with Theon Greyjoy, after the latter came to Winterfell following the conclusion of Greyjoy's Rebellion.\nJon grew close to his true-born siblings, especially Robb and Arya. As a young child Jon and Robb built a great mountain of snow on top of a gate, hoping to push in on someone passing by. They were discovered by Mance Rayder, a ranger from the Night's Watch who had accompanied Lord Commander Qorgyle to Winterfell. The ranger promised not to tell anyone, and Jon and Robb succeeded in their ploy, being chased around the yard by Fat Tom, their victim. Jon and Robb would often play a game of sword-play, in which they would pretend to be great heroes (including Florian the Fool, Aemon the Dragonknight, King Daeron I Targaryen, and Ser Ryam Redwyne). Once, when Jon called out that he was \"Lord of Winterfell\", Robb informed him that it was impossible due to his bastardy, which would become a sore memory for Jon. Another time, Jon covered himself in flour and hid in one of the empty tombs in the crypt of Winterfell, and jumped out to scare Sansa, Arya, and Bran, who had been brought to the crypts by Robb.Since he was young, Jon's hero was King Daeron, the Young Dragon, who had conquered Dorne at the age of fourteen. Lord Eddard had dreamed about raising new lords and settling them in the abandoned holdfasts in the New Gift, and Jon believes that, had winter come and gone more quickly, he might have been chosen to hold one of the settlements in his father's name.\n\n\n== Recent Events ==\n\n\n=== A Game of Thrones ===\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Jon accompanies his father, Lord Eddard Stark, his brothers Robb and Bran, his father's ward Theon Greyjoy, and others from Winterfell to the execution of a deserter from the Night's Watch. On their way back to Winterfell, Jon and Robb find a litter of direwolf pups. When Eddard states that killing the pups quickly would forestall a painful and slow death, Jon points out that there are five pups – one for each of Eddard's legitimate children – and the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, indicating that they must be meant to have the wolves. The comparison only works out because Jon is not claiming a pup for himself, and Eddard gives in. As they leave, Jon discovers an albino pup, cast away from its litter. He claims the pup for his own, eventually naming it \"Ghost\".Jon is present during the feast welcoming King Robert I Baratheon to the north, where he speaks with his uncle, Benjen Stark, a brother of the Night's Watch. When Benjen suggests that the Night's Watch could use a man as observant as Jon, Jon quickly requests to accompany him to the Wall when he leaves, as even a bastard can rise to a position of honor there. Though Benjen is hesitant about having Jon join at such a young age, resulting in an argument causing Jon to storm out, Benjen later approaches maester Luwin with the idea. When Lord Eddard Stark decides to accept the position as Hand of the King at King's Landing, his wife Catelyn Tully refuses to allow Jon to remain at Winterfell. As Eddard feels he cannot take Jon south with him, Luwin suggests the Night's Watch for Jon, and Eddard agrees to make the arrangements.Though Jon had expressed interest in the Night's before, the decision for him to go to the Wall leaves him angry in the days before he is set to leave. The departure day is postponed following Bran's accident, but a fortnight after Bran's fall Jon and Benjen are ready to leave Winterfell. Jon says his last goodbyes, first to the comatose Bran, then to Robb, and finally to Arya, to whom he gives a Braavosi-type sword, which they name Needle. On his way to the Wall, Jon quickly becomes disillusioned with the Night's Watch, after meeting Yoren, a so-called wandering crow, and his new recruits. Jon speaks with and befriends Tyrion Lannister, whom he had met during the welcoming feast at Winterfell and who had decided to travel further north to see with Wall for himself.At Castle Black, Jon first remains aloof and distant making no friends; he scorns his fellow recruits who return the feeling, resenting him due to his attitude. Shortly after their arrival, his uncle Benjen leaves to lead a ranging, and while Jon requests to accompany him, Benjen refuses to allow it, leaving Jon angry. After a fight between Jon and several other recruits, Jon speaks with Donal Noye, the armorer at Castle Black, who points that Jon has been a bully to the other recruits. When a letter arrives from Winterfell informing Jon that Bran, though crippled, has awoken and will live, Jon is ecstatic, and when he returns to the Common Hall, he offers his fellow recruits advice on their swordplay. Jon soon becomes a natural leader, mentor, and friend to most of his fellow trainees, earning him the enmity of the master-at-arms, Ser Alliser Thorne. When Samwell Tarly arrives at the Wall, Jon reaches out to him, and helps him being accepted by the majority of the recruits.As new recruits are about to arrive at Castle Black, eight recruits, including Jon, are chosen to take their vows. Sam is not chosen, and Jon realises that it will only be a matter of time that Sam will be hurt of killed in training, without his friends present to protect him. Jon visits maester Aemon and asks if Aemon will persuade Lord Commander Mormont to take Sam from training and allow him to take his vows, pointing out that Sam, due to his ability to write, read, and to math, would make a good personal steward for Aemon, which earns Jon the enmity of Chett, Aemon's current steward. Aemon promises to consider it. Sam finds Jon the next day, informing him that he too is allowed to take his vows, and has been appointed Aemon's personal steward. Jon expects to be raised to the rangers, but is angered when Lord Commander Jeor Mormont appoints him as his personal steward, until Sam points out that Mormont if grooming him for command. Jon and Sam decide to say their vows in front of the weirwood trees located north of the [Wall]]. After they have said the words, Ghost returns with the severed hand of Jafer Flowers, alerting the men of the corpses of Jafer and Othor. The two corpses are brought back to Castle Black, where Jon is informed about the death of King Robert I Baratheon and the arrest of Eddard Stark. He attempts to attack Ser Alliser after he overhears him mocking Eddard and Jon, and is placed in isolation as a result. That night, the two deceased brothers they had found north of the Wall rise, and Jon manages to safe Mormont's life, seriously burning his hand in the process. In gratitude, Mormont gives Jon the Valyrian steel bastard sword, Longclaw, of House Mormont, on which he has had a direwolf head engraved onto the pommel in honor of House Stark.Though he is now officially a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, Jon becomes torn between the Watch and his former family when he learns from Sam that Robb Stark has marched south with an army. Maester Aemon explains to Jon the difficulty of keeping true to the Night's Watch's vows at times, citing among other examples the deaths of most of his relatives at the end of Robert's Rebellion, causing Jon to realise Aemon is a Targaryen. Nonetheless, Jon tries to desert and join Robb's army after Eddard's execution, even though the common penalty for deserting the Night's Watch is death. His new friends bring him back, however, and save him from this fate.The next day, Lord Commander Mormont chastises him for running, and Jon agrees to fully commit to the Watch. He accepts his place as Mormont's squire and prepares for the journey north, on the large Ranging into the lands north of the Wall that Mormont plans to lead.\n\n\n=== A Clash of Kings ===\n\nThe Night's Watch prepares for the great ranging north to investigate the haunted forest, after the disappearances of several rangers, including Benjen Stark, beyond the Wall. Jon brings his direwolf, Ghost.\nJon fetches Samwell Tarly for Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, who has been waiting for maps of the lands further north. Jeor and Jon discuss his hand, which still troubles him, but is slowly getting better. They discuss Maester Aemon, and Jeor reveals that Aemon had once been offered the Iron Throne, but instead had decided to remain a maester, and the throne passed to his younger brother, Aegon IV Targaryen. Jeor points out the similarities between Jon and Aemon in having a brother for king; Jon reassures the Lord Commander that, like Maester Aemon, he too will keep his vows.The ranging party passes through several wildling villages, including Whitetree, but find no hint of any wildling presence. They then stop at Craster's Keep, where they learn that the normally anarchic wildlings are uniting under a single figure, King-beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. Though they are commanded not to speak to Craster's daughters, Gilly, one of Craster's daughters who is pregnant with his child, approaches Jon after encouragement from Sam. She asks to join Jon when they leave Craster's Keep, but Jon refuses her, and later scolds Sam for ever having given her the idea. After reaching the Fist of the First Men, Ghost leads Jon to a mound where the direwolf digs up an old warhorn and a cache of dragonglass wrapped in an old cloak of the Night's Watch. Jon distributes these items among his sworn brothers. After the arrival of Qhorin Halfhand with the men from the Shadow Tower, Jon is picked by Qhorin to accompany one of the three scouting parties into the mountains.In the Skirling Pass, Qhorin's party comes across a group of wildling sentries, and Jon is one of those assigned to take them out. He kills one of the man, but discovers his second target is a woman. Jon decides to take the girl, called Ygritte, prisoner instead. He reveals to her that he is the bastard son of Eddard Stark, and during the night, Ygritte tells Jon the story of \"Bael the Bard\", a song which insinuates that, through Bael, the Starks too have wildling blood. Later, Qhorin orders Jon to kill her, but Jon secretly lets her go instead. Before she leaves, Ygritte informs Jon that Mance Rayder would accept him, if he wanted to join the free folk. Jon tells Qhorin about this, who confirms that Mance would be willing, and tells Jon that Mance had been a man of the Night's Watch himself once. That night, when Jon dreams he sees through the eyes of Ghost, and witnesses thousands of wildlings, and giants and mammoths, before being attacked by an eagle. Jon informs the group, who recognize Jon for a warg. They later see the eagle, and when they find a wounded Ghost, Qhorin decides they return to the Fist of the First Men. With the enemy following them, Qhorin orders Dalbridge to stay behind to defend the others, while Ebben and Stonesnake are sent forth to reach the First is great haste, leaving only Qhorin and Jon. Qhorin commands Jon to join the wildlings when they are discovered, and to do whatever they ask. When the wildling band led by Rattleshirt finds them, Jon yields, and the wildlings require him to kill Qhorin to proof his loyalty to them. With the help of Ghost, Jon kills Qhorin, and the wildlings agree to bring him to Mance Rayder.\n\n\n=== A Storm of Swords ===\n\nJon meets with Mance Rayder and convinces him that his desertion is sincere. During their conversation, Jon learns Mance's plans to invade the Seven Kingdoms. He falls in love with Ygritte and briefly breaks his vows of chastity with her. He hesitates between betraying her or leaving the Night's Watch, eventually realizing that he must escape and warn them of the upcoming attack. Jon joins Styr's mission to scale the Wall and take unaware the skeleton crew left manning Castle Black. After scaling the wall, he gets the opportunity to escape as the wildlings are attacked by Summer in the vicinity of the abandoned Queenscrown - unaware that it is due to the efforts of his half-brother Bran, who is hidden in a nearby castle. He manages to escape in the confusion on a horse, but not before taking an arrow in the leg.Jon reaches Castle Black barely conscious. He is tended to by Maester Aemon and warns the Night's Watch of the upcoming attack of the wildlings. Maester Aemon and Grenn gently break the news to Jon that his brothers, Bran and Rickon, have died at the command of Theon Greyjoy. After Jon recuperates, he helps Donal Noye in the Defence of Castle Black against Styr's raiders. All of the raiders are killed, including Ygritte, who dies in a grief-stricken Jon's arms. After the fall of Donal, Jon reluctantly takes command of the Wall's defences against Mance's direct assault after prompting from Master Aemon. Using his natural leadership, Jon successfully holds the Wall against overwhelming odds for several days. However, upon the arrival of Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt to Castle Black, Jon is arrested for his earlier defection and thrown in an ice cell, where he is threatened with execution for his desertion and murder of Qhorin Halfhand. After Aemon vouches for Jon's honour and capability during the wildling attack, Thorne and Slynt realize they cannot have Jon hanged due to his popularity on the Wall and therefore force him to make an assassination attempt on Mance during a parley, hoping he will be killed there instead. During the negotiations, Mance states that he has the Horn of Winter, which he claims will cause the Wall to collapse; he reveals that he only had the wildlings attack the wall not to conquer, but to escape the Others. The King-Beyond-the-Wall then offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night's Watch allows the wildlings to safely pass through to South of the Wall, but states that they will not yield to the lords or their laws. Before Jon can attack Mance or destroy the Horn, Stannis Baratheon's forces make a surprise appearance and rout the wildlings.\n\nJon's service defending the Wall earns him popular support and his release from imprisonment. Jon meets with Stannis, who tells him that if he recognizes Stannis as king, he will legitimize him and make him Lord Jon Stark of Winterfell, as he needs \"a son of Ned Stark\" in order to gain support of the North.  He is overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and grief for his dead siblings, especially since he bitterly admits to himself that becoming Lord of Winterfell was something he always desired, and that he was always envious of Robb for his legitimate birthright. Meanwhile, however, due to the efforts of Samwell Tarly, Jon has been voted as a compromise candidate between rival factions of the Watch for the post of Lord Commander. Unaware of this, Jon musings on being legitimized are interrupted by Ghost's return from beyond the Wall, to their mutual joy. He is reminded of the day the Starks found the direwolves near Winterfell; Ghost had the red eyes of the weirwood, and he recognizes that Ghost \"belongs to the old gods\", as does Winterfell. He realizes that if he bends the knee to Stannis he would have to choose to yield the castle to Stannis' priestess Melisandre, and give her leave to burn the heart tree, a choice which Jon deems to be disrespectful. Thus, he refuses Stannis and becomes the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in a landslide vote, to his own disbelief. His earliest acts as Lord Commander serve to frustrate the plots of Melisandre by secretly sending Mance's child away from the Wall and impersonating him with another.\nSeparately, Robb Stark, believing Bran, Rickon, and Arya to be dead, decides to legitimise Jon and name him his heir over his mother Catelyn's objections, to prevent Winterfell and the North from falling into Lannister hands following Tyrion Lannister's marriage to Sansa. The decree is witnessed by Robb's bannermen prior to their arrival at The Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding; however it is unknown how widely the decree has been disseminated, if at all, and Jon remains ignorant of his legitimisation by Robb.\n\n\n=== A Feast for Crows ===\nIn King's Landing, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister is outraged to learn of Jon's appointment as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, as he has given Stannis shelter. The small council agrees that Jon must be removed from command. Pycelle suggests to inform the Watch that the crown will sent no more men to the Wall until Jon is removed, but Qyburn suggests that they send a hundred men to the Wall who will be given the secret order to remove Jon. Cersei is delighted with the idea. She plots to send Ser Osney Kettleblack to carry out the plan, but both Osney and Cersei are imprisoned by the Faith before these plans can come to fruition.\n\n\n=== A Dance with Dragons ===\nSlowly Jon grows into his position as a leader. Jon takes up residence within Donal Noye's quarters, following the blacksmith's death in the previous novel. Jon is continually harassed, predominantly by Stannis's men, who have taken up residence within Castle Black and the Nightfort, which Jon granted to Stannis as thanks for his aid against the wildling assault. He attempts to maintain the neutrality of the Watch in the ongoing civil war for the Iron Throne, walking a political tightrope as Queen Regent Cersei Lannister is outraged that Eddard Stark's bastard son is now commanding the Wall.\nJon rebukes all demands from Stannis to settle his men within the Gift, claiming that the land and all of the sixteen unoccupied castles along the Wall as belonging to the Night's Watch. He sends Sam to the Citadel to train as Castle Black's next maester.  With him, he sends Gilly, Maester Aemon, and the infant son of Mance Rayder, the last two for fear that Melisandre might want to use their royal blood for her magic. He constantly broods upon the last words Maester Aemon gave to him before leaving, in which the maester explained how his younger brother, a grown man with children of his own when he ascended the Iron Throne, had seemed like a child in some ways. Aemon informs Jon that his advice to Aegon had been \"Kill the boy and let the man be born.\", and that he has the same advice for Jon.}}\n\nWhen Jon orders Janos Slynt to garrison one of the abandoned castles along the Wall, Janos refuses. Jon publicly points out that the punishment for refusing a direct command is death, yet gives Janos three chances to follow orders (noting as he does so that it was more chances than Janos gave his father when he betrayed Ned two years prior). After Slynt refuses once more, scoffing at the idea that Jon can command him or the Night's Watch, Jon orders him to be executed for his insubordination. However, he then recalls the laws of the First Men and his father, and beheads Slynt himself, using Longclaw to carry out the sentence and exacting small justice for Ned. This increases Stannis' respect for Jon and cements his new position.Jon displeases his fellow commanders of the Night's Watch by sending the wildling Val to treat with Tormund Giantsbane. This results in a fragile alliance between the Night's Watch and the wildlings. Jon settles the wildlings on the Gift and gives the warriors the opportunity to guard the Wall by garrisoning unoccupied castles against the Others. As the wildings are moved into the gift, Mance Rayder is given to the flames by Melisandre. It is later revealed, however, that the burned man was in fact Rattleshirt under a glamour created by Melisandre. Mance is sent by Jon to secretly rescue his sister Arya Stark from Ramsay Bolton, being unaware that it is actually Jeyne Poole.\nWith Stannis about to march on Deepwood Motte, Jon advises him to seek the help of the Northern mountain clans. Following Jon's advice, Stannis is able to secure the allegiance of the clans, greatly augmenting his own strength. Soon after Stannis has taken Deepwood, news arrive of Ramsay Bolton's impending marriage to \"Arya Stark\". Stannis immediately marches on Winterfell, the chosen site for the marriage, to face the forces of the Boltons.\n\nMelisandre tells Jon she sees in her flames a girl on a dying horse making for Castle Black; she is convinced it must be Arya escaped from the Boltons. Melisandre also tells him she sees him surrounded by daggers in the dark, but he pays no mind to this warning. When Jon is awoken by Mully, who tells him that a girl has arrived on a dying horse, Jon's thoughts instantly go to Melisandre's vision; he giddily thinks that Arya may have come to him as prophesied and he and his half-sister will be reunited, but recognizes the girl as Alys Karstark, who states that she is fleeing a forced marriage to her uncle Cregan Karstark. Alys tells Jon her uncle only desires her because she is heir to Karhold and pleas Jon for his help. He arranges a marriage between her and Sigorn, a wildling, and thus establishes a new house of Thenn. When Cregan arrives at Castle Black with reinforcements to claim Alys, Jon has them thrown in an ice cell. Weeks after Stannis has departed for Winterfell and is supposedly rallying his troops to battle, Jon receives a taunting letter purportedly from Ramsay Bolton entitled 'Bastard,' which claims that Stannis has been defeated and Mance Rayder captured. It demands fealty from Jon to House Bolton if the Night's Watch is to survive and gives a detailed account of Ramsay's actions which Jon views to his disgust repeatedly sully the honor of what was once the ancient seat of House Stark. He responds to Ramsay's letter by relinquishing command of an impending ranging and announcing his intention to ride South against the Boltons. He does not order the Night's Watch to fight with him, but asks both wildlings and black brothers alike to join him of their own volition. Jon's decision (which is in violation of his oaths) causes great discontent within the Watch's upper leadership; in the confusion resulting from Wun Wun's killing of Ser Patrek of King's Mountain, he is stabbed repeatedly by Bowen Marsh and other black brothers, who attack in tears while muttering \"for the Watch\". Whether or not Jon survives this attack is currently unknown.\n\n\n== Parentage ==\nMain article: Jon Snow/TheoriesJon Snow's parentage remains a topic of discussion among readers of the series, as his mother remains unidentified. On several occcasions, the topic is brought to the reader's attention in text, although several characters provide different possibilities. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Tully heard from her maids the tales Eddard's soldiers had told about Ashara Dayne, though Eddard refused to confirm this when she confronted him, and silenced the stories about Ashara at Winterfell. Cersei Lannister  Years later, Sansa Stark heard rumors saying that Jon's mother had been a common woman. Cersei Lannister mentions Ashara Dayne as Jon's potential mother as well, as well as \"some dornish peasant\". Eddard seems to have told King Robert I Baratheon that Jon's mother was a woman named Wylla, though Robert has never seen her. Meanwhile, Lord Edric Dayne believes his wetnurse, Wylla, to have been Jon's mother. However, according to Lord Godric Borrell, the daughter of the fisherman who brought Eddard Stark from the Vale across the Bite to the North at the beginning of Robert's Rebellion gave birth to Eddard's bastard son, and according to him, it had been her who gave Jon his name, in honor of Jon Arryn.Fans of the series have speculated about his parentage for many years, with numerous theories having been over during that time.\n\n\n== Quotes by Jon ==\n– Jon to Arya Stark\n\n– Jon to Tyrion Lannister\n\n – Jon, on himself\n\n – Jon's thoughts after his father's execution\n\n– Jon to Samwell Tarly\n\n– Jon to Samwell Tarly\n\n– Before the execution of Janos Slynt\n\n\n== Quotes about Jon ==\n – Tyrion Lannister to Jon\n\n – Eddard Stark to Catelyn Tully\n\n– Catelyn Tully\n\n– Robb Stark to Catelyn Tully on his plans to name Jon heir to the North\n\n– Maester Aemon about Jon's accomplishments and loyalties\n\n – Varamyr\n\n– Melisandre\n\n– Melisandre\n\n– Cregan Karstark to Jon\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Chess is played by millions of people worldwide, both amateurs and professionals.\nEach player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.",
